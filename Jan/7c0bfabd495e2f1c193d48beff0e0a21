A bi-weekly podcast hosted by lipstick enthusiasts KENYA and ZEE, covering pop culture, societal issues and football. We start the year off by discussing Cardi B, racism and Uber. We then unpack the dynamics within the Black LGBQT community and how hetero folks can be better allies.  Follow us on Twitter: @Zeekny and @Obvszee.
