Around 50,000 people used the “Click, Check and Confirm” feature to update their address details over the weekend. While the IEC were generally pleased with the results of the weekend, they have expressed concerns. The Commission says that over 9 million eligible voters have not registered for the elections. Of that number 6 million are under the age of 30 years old. During early February, the Commission will be holding registration drives at universities around the country. This is in order to increase the number of registrations among young people. For South Africans living overseas – a registration weekend will be held February 1-4.
