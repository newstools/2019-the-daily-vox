Comic Con Africa is back, and even bigger. The 2019 edition of the convention took place from September 21-24. Despite some of the big names originally on the roster dropping out, fans attended the event in their numbers. There was something for everything including the addition of KidsCon. Here’s a sneak peek of the event for those who couldn’t attend. Reedpop Exhibitions are the company behind Comic Con. Carol Weaving, Reedpop CEO told The Daily Vox that because of the huge success of the 2018 version, they had to move to a bigger venue. “It just goes to show how pop culture, in general, is growing in South Africa. We’ve had a lot of people coming in from over the border which is really exciting. It shows that our neighbours are really getting involved,” Weaving said. One of the biggest names at the convention this year was Willian Shatner who played Captain Kirk in the Star Trek movies. Shatner had the audience in stitches during his panel. He also imparted some life advice for those in the audience. “Follow your own path. Nobody can tell you what to do in your life. Only you can,” said Shatner Building on the massive success of last year’s Comic-Con, there will be a Comic-Con taking place in Cape Town in 2020. “In May 2020, there’s going to be Comic-Con Cape Town. There’s going to be fundamental changes between Cape Town and Joburg. There’s going to be a much bigger focus on animation and film because Cape Town is fast becoming one of the film capitals of the world,” said Weaving. Comic-Con Africa is taking place at the Gallagher Convention Centre. Tickets are available online or at the door. Featured image by Fatima Moosa
