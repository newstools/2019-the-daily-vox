Hundreds of Wits University students gathered at the Great Hall piazza to protest against gender-based violence and femicide. The protest is in response to the growing call to end gender-based violence and femicide following the rape and murder of 19-year-old University of Cape Town (UCT) student Uyinene Mrwetyana. The Daily Vox collected pictures of the placards.
