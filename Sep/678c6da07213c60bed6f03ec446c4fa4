On Friday, hundreds of people marched to Sandton, the business hub of the country, to protest gender-based violence and femicide, inspired by the news of the rape and murder of 19-year-old University of Cape Town (UCT) student Uyinene Mrwetyana. This protest was organised by civil society groups from around South Africa. Photos by FATIMA MOOSA and SHAAZIA EBRAHIM. Featured image by Fatima Moosa
