The fight over the amendment of Section 25 of the Constitution will be taken to court, Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane said at the party’s manifesto rally on Saturday. He also said the party favoured a market system and property ownership. “I also dream of making all South Africans the owners of their homes, with full title deed. I’m not interested in a system where people must live at the mercy of the state on land owned by the state,” Maimane said. “We don’t just oppose the amending of the Constitution for the sake of it. We want to ensure that Section 25 is protected. This matter will end up in court.” Last year, the African National Congress (ANC), with the help of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), resolved in parliament to amend the constitution to specify the conditions under which expropriation of land can occur without compensation. But Maimane said that the move would not expand the freedom of citizens. Land Expropriation: How The Constitution Will Be Changed  “I want people to own their land and to own their houses, because property ownership is everything. It allows you to borrow money against the property, it allows you to pass it on to your children in your will, and it allows you to sell it, if you so choose,” he said. “I also want South Africans to have choice, which is why we will introduce a housing voucher which people can either use to build their home or as a down-payment on a house. “In the South Africa I want to build you will find estate agents in Alexandra and Khayelitsha, and not just in Sandton and Constantia, because property will have value wherever you go,” Maimane said. How The DA Would Fix Higher Education  In the manifesto, the DA says it would give housing recipients three options: free housing for those earning under R4,000 per month, a housing scheme voucher which people can use as down payment on a new house, or inner city social and rent-controlled housing.
